# 31263-Assessment 3 AND 4
## Classic Game Recreation Assessment : Pac - man
A Pac-Man clone made in Unity for a graded university assignment. The first level is a clone of the game while the second level has a small but significant twist.
Unity version 2020.2.4f1 is specifically used for this project.

#### Changes for Level 2
- A "Hunger" bar is added: This bar will decrease rapidly over time and will trigger prematurely end the game when it reaches zero. Collecting pellets will reset the bar.
  - This makes so that the player has to strategically decide which routes to clear pellets from while dodging enemies.
- Endless gameplay: There are only half the number of pellets on the field at the start, when all pellets and powerups have been consumed, a quarter of default pellet number will regenerate, and only half of the powerups will be regenerated.
 
#### Assets
Visuals (Sprites, animations, etc.) and musics are original. Sound effects are generated with BXFR (https://www.bfxr.net)
